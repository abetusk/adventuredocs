# Test out AdventureDocs

We've included a demo! Checkout the `testdocs/` directory! It
contains markdown files which represent sections, and an `ORDER`
file which specifies the default order of the sections.

All you have to do to get started is:

  1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. `python adocs.py testdocs outputfile.html`

Then you can view `outputfile.html` in your web browser!
