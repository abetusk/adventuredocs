# AdventureDocs: Getting Started

Choose Your Own Adventure style software documentation from markdown.

Markdown source, when parsed, outputs to a single HTML page.

Here's how it's used:

    adoc = AdventureDoc.from_directory("some_dir")
    print(adoc)

You can read notes or just skip to the end demo:

NEXT_SECTION:

  * notes.md
  * demo.md
